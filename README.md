# Week 3 Lecture Exercises

## Instructions

Each directory contains an exercise. For each exercise, there is a `main.cpp`
file that contains some code and instructions for the exercise.

Your task is to modify this `main.cpp` file according to the instructions.

## Testing

In each firectory there is also a `run_test.cpp` source file that contains
tests of the `main.cpp` file. The `run_test.sh` file is a simple script that
builds and executable and runs the tests. Do not modify these files, however
you can test your code locally by running the `run_tests.sh` file. If there
are no errors, a success message will be printed.
